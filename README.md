# Give-it-a-Trie-
A scrabble word finder.

This is a project started at the 2019 UCF Hack-A-Thon. The point of the project was to try to code up a Trie with a larger dataset
to see how well it would go. 

Description:
This is a basic scrabble cheat. You input the letters that are on your rack (Syntax: "ABCDE") and the letter(s) you want to build off of 
(Syntax: "AF").
